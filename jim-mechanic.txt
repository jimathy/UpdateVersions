3.6.15

- Rewrite the GetVehicleProperties and SetVehicleProperties functions
  - Now they are exactly the same on qb-core and ox_lib, REPLACE BOTH IF YOU HAVE BOTH
- Add vehicle_props_validator.lua that warns users if they haven't replaced the functions
  - (Can't wait for the anticheat tickets)
- Fix Crafting and Repairs always using stashes (made the new functions TOO certain)
- Fix Personal Stash creation (fixes not registered function)
- Refactor Server Side stash creation, this should fix things like boss stashes not changing slots
