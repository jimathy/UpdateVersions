2.1.0

- Ported to `jim_bridge` to be more optimizied and automated
- Now supports `qb-core`, `ox_core`, `qbox` and `esx` (with ox)
- Supports more inventories thanks to `jim_bridge`
- Reorganised script files to make more sense
- `jim_bridge` allows users to create custom peds based on multiplayer peds
    - Check stores.lua for the ways to do this
    - (its based on the id numbers of clothing items)
- SQL now installs itself so no need to run any `.sql` files anymore
- Can't remember what else I changed <3 just fixes and optimizations
